# Problem Description

This project applies the the process for developing a Machine Learning (ML) Model described in the chaper "End-to-End Machine Learning Project"[^1] with the goal of creating a ML model to predict genres and popularity of tracks on Spotify based on other features defined for each of these songs.

The core idea is to produce 2 pipelines in parallel, working independant of each other. One pipeline should end with a model to be used to predict popularity of future songs from the given features, and the other to try and predict the genre of a given song. As such, this project will work both with regression and classification. It must be stated that in order for this process to work, for either of the prediction of a quantity or category, there must be some correlation/distinction between the features. Thus, the underlying assumption for the project, and decision to use the dataset, is that the features generated by spotify to describe their songs is connected in some way - and our goal is find an algorithm that can use that connection for prediction, if it is there. 

Since the data set include the target value of our predictions, these  features will be seperated from the data set and vil be used as the labels in training the model using supervised learning, both the classification and regression problem fits this training strategy.

The "End-to-End" process and supervised learning concepts will be further explained in the following two sections.
