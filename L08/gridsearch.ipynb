    "\n",
    "When instantiating a Scikit-learn model in python most or all constructor parameters have _default_ values. These values are not part of the internal model and are hence called ___hyperparametes___---in contrast to _normal_ model parameters, say the weights, $\\mathbf w$, for an `SGD` model.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example could be the python constructor for the support-vector classifier `sklearn.svm.SVC`, with, say the `kernel` hyperparameter having the default value `'rbf'`. If you should choose, what would you set it to other than `'rbf'`? \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class sklearn.svm.SVC(\n",
    "    C=1.0, \n",
    "    kernel=’rbf’, \n",
    "    degree=3,\n",
    "    gamma=’auto_deprecated’, \n",
    "    coef0=0.0, \n",
    "    shrinking=True, \n",

    "    random_state=None\n",
    "  )\n",
    "```  \n",
    "\n",
    "The default values might be sensible a general starting point, but for your data, you might want to optimize the hyperparameters to yield a better result. \n",
    "\n",
    "To be able to set `kernel` to a sensible value you need to go into the documentation for the `SVC` and understand what the kernel parameter represents and what values it can be set to, and you need to understand the consequences of setting `kernel` to something different than the default...and the story repeats for every other hyperparameter!\n",
    "\n",
    "An alternative is just to __brute-force__ a search of interesting hyperparameters, an choosing the 'best' parameters according to a fit-predict and some performance metric, say 'f1'. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, you just pick out some hyperparameters, that you figure are important, set them to a suitable range, say\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    'kernel':('linear', 'rbf'), \n",
    "    'C':[1, 10]\n",
    "```\n",
    "and fire up a full (grid) search on this hyperparameter set, that will try out all combination of `kernel` and `C` for the model, and then prints the hyperparameter set with the highest score...\n",

Now, an important part to note is the use of the GridSearchCV attributes in regards to the print out of the best result(e.g, the set of variables producing the best score from the chosen scoring method). A list of the attributes of GridSearchCV can be found in the scikit learn documentation, but the important part here is to note that after running the search, it automatically stores the best result for us, and it makes it easy for us to access this as seen from the helper functions. \n",

    "\n",
    "- __\"model\" :__  is the estimator passed to be evaluated using the gridsearch. The estimator must contain a scoring function, and if not, the scoring parameter must be set - intuitively this makes sense as the evaluation requires a measure of goodness in order to compare results. \n",
    "\n",
    "- __\"tuning_parameters\" :__ Must be a dictionary holding string parameters as keys, and lists of values. This dictionary will then be expanded to search evaluate the estimator in regards to combinations of the values and names in the dictionary - a grid is made. \n",
    "\n",
    "- __\"cv\" :__ Is a \"cross-validation generator\". Here one can specify which method to use for cross validation, some knowns and covered in class is KFold and Elastic Net. \n",
    "\n",
    "- __\"f1_micro\" :__ The scoring function to be used - can either be a callable(user defined) or a predefined one, like the \"f1_micro\". \n",
    "\n",
    "- __\"iid\" :__ Independently Identically distributed. This requires specific knowledge of the dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "- __\"n_jobs\" :__ Defines the number of \"jobs\"(processes) to run in parallel. \n",
    "\n",
    "With the above, one can run the objects fit method afterwards, and thus perform the gridsearch of the specified data. The results is printed using the objects attributes and helpers from codeblock 1. \n"
